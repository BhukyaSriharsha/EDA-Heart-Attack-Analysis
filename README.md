🩺Heart Attack Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🧠 Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a heart attack dataset to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and key risk factors affecting heart disease likelihood.
The analysis leverages Python’s data visualization and statistical libraries to gain insights for healthcare and prevention strategies.

🗂️ Dataset Information

The dataset contains patient-level information including:

Age

Gender

Chest pain type (cp)

Resting blood pressure (trestbps)

Cholesterol level (chol)

Fasting blood sugar (fbs)

Resting ECG results (restecg)

Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

Exercise-induced angina (exang)

Oldpeak (ST depression)

Slope of peak exercise ST segment (slope)

Number of major vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = healthy)

🧩 Key Objectives

Perform data cleaning and handle missing/outlier values.

Conduct univariate & multivariate analysis.

Visualize relationships using plots.

Identify key factors influencing heart attack risk.

Generate actionable health insights.

🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
Category	Tools
Programming	Python
Libraries	pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
IDE	Jupyter Notebook
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn
Version Control	Git + GitHub
📈 Insights

Some key takeaways from the analysis include:

Males show higher heart disease frequency than females.

Increasing age correlates with higher chances of heart disease.

High cholesterol and resting blood pressure are common indicators.

Exercise-induced angina and lower maximum heart rate are strong predictors.

📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes:

Correlation heatmap

Age distribution & risk comparison

Pairplots for relationships

Heart disease frequency across genders

Feature-wise boxplots
